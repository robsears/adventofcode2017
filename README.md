# Advent of Code 2017

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

The AoC is 25 holiday-themed challenges, each with 2 parts. Last year, I wanted to brush up on my Java skills, and so I solved all the challenges in Java. This year, I want to try something even more challenging.

I've challenged myself to solve all the problems in different languages. One language per day. Once I use a language to solve a puzzle, that language can't be used again for any other puzzle.

However, given the number of challenges versus the number of practical languages (with enough documentation that I can reasonably learn it well enough to solve a problem), I will count dialects as different languages. For example, PHP and [Hack](http://hacklang.org/) count as different languages.

The goal here is to get exposure to, and experience with, a variety of languages. The idioms and features built into a set of instructions are designed around specific problem domains, and a hands-on survey of this will, hopefully, make me a better programmer overall.
